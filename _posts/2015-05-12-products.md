# Products

## Ordering products in the Shop grid
To change the order that products appear in the Shop grid:
1. go to Products/Collections/All
2. under ‘Products,’ drag the products into the order you want them to appear

## Associating a product with a filter option
1. go to a product page in the admin
2. on the right under Organization, pull down to an existing or type a new product category. Make sure it matches the filter name exactly.
3. click save

## Tagging images
The system uses *alt tags* to make sure that photos end up where they’re supposed to. To edit a photos alt tag, go to the **Images** section on a product page. When you hover over an image, you’ll see an **ALT** button. Clicking it brings up a layer where you can enter the required *alt tag*.

## Shopping cart product images
The shopping cart and checkout display the *first* image listed in a product page. Shopify automatically crops these square, so best to use a product image with some space on the edges.
